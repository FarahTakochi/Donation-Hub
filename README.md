# Donation-Hub

## Project Description

For this project, we planned to create a website which  highlights the theme of  “Organisation” where we will start a mock organisation, Donation Hub, which focuses on helping to improve the lives of the poor and needy in our community. In line with the global goals, we hope for this website to make a positive impact on as many Sustainable Development Goals as possible such as No poverty, Zero Hunger and Good Health and Well-being with the motto of  “Spread Hands for Love”.

Our website consists of five main pages which are the Homepage, Catalogue, Volunteer, News and Contact Us. Alegreya and Alegreya Sans will be used as our website primary fonts. The background colour for our website will be mostly white with some other colours such as different shades of greens and yellows to enhance and furnish the website. For this website, we are going with the concept of minimal and clean green look as we wish to make the user's experience worthwhile and more enjoyable while navigating through our website.

For the organisation flow, firstly, our homepage will display a short description of our project goals and some buttons that will link to our other pages. Other than that, this website lets the user donate their belongings. Under the “Catalogue” page, the users can choose which item that they want to donate to the needy people. Furthermore, users that are interested to help distribute the donated items are welcome to register as volunteers under the “Volunteer” page. The “News” page will display the ongoing and upcoming events pertaining to charity events. Any inquiries can be made through the “Contact Us” page where the user can choose to leave a question or contact us through specific channels.
